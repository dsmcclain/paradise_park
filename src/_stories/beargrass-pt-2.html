summary: "This is a story about hiking. Not really about beargrass."

<p><span class="post-content">You're breathing hard. A rock shifts under your foot when you apply your weight. You can feel the power of your body in your hips. Your back measures your toil. Through the silent assembly of trees a single snag leans at a different angle. It sways under the weight of a vulture, who gives a heavy push-off the moment you become aware of it.</span></p>

<p><span class="post-content">You think about an email. A video you watched yesterday on youtube, making fun of a baseball player. That weirdly voice from the radio commercial on the drive out. Hopefully your car is in decent shape and you won't need to take it in anytime soon. That would be inconvenient.</span></p>

<p><span class="post-content">One time I took mushrooms at the top of a slope and by the end of the descent I was three thousand years old. I was reborn in the river and hiked up the other side while my skin grew from a thin wrapper to a soft, dense pudge of protection around my new body. Birds were cheering me forward. The trees cried tears of joy, blessing the crown of my head with delicate tears of pollen. I floated up to the clouds and there was paradise park.</span></p>
